# Welcome to Twippit

This is the web app portion of our hacking challenge to work with Headless Chrome and Puppeteer.

In this application, you will be able to type in a twitter handle, and Twippit will try and scrape the Twitter profile of that handle

## Directions

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Do I need to build anything within this application?

No, you will not have to edit the code in this project (only if you want to!).

If you can successfully implement Puppeteer on the API, this project will display the proper Twitter profile
